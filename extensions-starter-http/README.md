 # Extension Starter
 This is a template to get started with extensions.
 
 ## Usage
 Please take a look at the class `com.appdynamics.monitors.StarterMonitor` as the starting point.
 The `execute` method is the entry method.  This class does the initialization and triggers the execution
 of the task `com.appdynamics.monitors.StarterMonitorTask`. 
 
 The task in this case is executed in a thread pool. The business logic is contained in the task class. 
 The task class fetches the data through an http call and then reports the metric.  
  
 ## Build
 Its maven, you know how to build!
 `mvn clean install`
